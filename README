This is a simple task list that was written to be placed on the main page of a web-site I was working on (and also so I could learn more about graphics / vectors / animations / etc.  the PDE files are related to the language called Processing (http://processing.org).

This was originally written quite some time ago so unfortunately I have no idea how it holds up under the new Processing v2.0.  Perhaps an update is in order.
